        <p> I have used Jenny to clean my apartment twice. She is the only cleaning service I have ever used in Greenwich, CT. Her house cleaning service is phenomenal. She is easy to contact and has a short turnaround. She is very pleasant and her pricing is competitive. I have no complaints and I strongly recommend Jenny.</p>

        <p> I am so pleased with today. I feel like so much weight has lifted off my shoulders. I am so pleased with whom came to my house today. So nice and helpful. Gave great tips on organization and cleanliness of a home. I have a big home. It can get overwhelming at times. Total of 5 people live in the home. Also with 3 dogs.

Keep up the great work of done pretty amazing companies.</p>
